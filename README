To compile you need:
 - CMake
 - Development headers for libqt4, libkdeui, libkfile and libsolid. 

Run from the source directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
make
sudo make install

Note that this will install a policykit file that allows any user to have kup run 'bup' as root without asking for password.
