 - SSH as backup destination. Would be easy to add but I have not been motivated yet.
   - could use ssh to test destination availablility:
     ssh -q -o "BatchMode=yes" user@host "echo 2>&1" && echo "OK" || echo "NOK"
 - KIO slave to see a bup archive in a file manager, could be based on libgit2 instead of fuse-mount.
   Would be nicer than having to unmount after being done.
 - Add a bup repo browser program, using the kioslave. And perhaps doing some direct 
   access to the repo, maybe share some code with kioslave for that.
   Would show history for selected file or folder in a separate view next to the 
   main file/folder view. Or something like that. Would allow for opening a file at a specific time stamp.
   Or dragging-dropping it to another app. Would give a bup:// kioslave url as source for opening or for drag action.
 - Continous backups: monitoring the local filesystem for changes and imediately backing up 
   the changed file if destination is available.
 - Make bup give out percentage complete and use this to present completion in systray tooltip.
    - Patch done and posted to mailing list, probably no one noticed...
 - Warn user when using rsync to backup to a ntfs or fat backup, will lose permissions. Maybe other filesystems too? Maybe more info lost?
 - If user has more than one plan, make daemon tooltip specify status for individual plans, not just the worst: "new backup suggested".. 

Known issues
 - bup doesn't seem to handle including a folder under an excluded one. Need to investigate. Thought I had tested this to work 
before... hmm..
 - Downloading a symlink should, I assums, not download the target file. But "kioclient download" does not create a symlink, it's marked a a regular 
file. And on the other hand, opening a symlink from dolphin should open the target file, but it doesn't.
