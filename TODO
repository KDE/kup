 - what happens if you change configuration while backup is running? 
   Executor gets deleted, slot gets disconnected and backup never registered as 
   finished? But if we wait with deleting until backup has completed, maybe we 
   will overwrite the correct status with backup status for a plan that no longer exists..
 - SSH as backup destination. Would be easy to add but I have not been motivated yet.
 - KIO slave to see a bup archive in a file manager, could be based on libgit2 instead of fuse-mount. 
   Also could be nice to have a view here where each file is represented as a directory and under 
   that is the different timestamps of that file, would make it easier to find earlier versions of files.
 - Continous backups: monitoring the local filesystem for changes and imediately backing up 
   the changed file if destination is available.
 - Make bup give out percentage complete and use this to present completion in systray tooltip.
 - Figure out a file format for backup exclude config files, maybe system-wide under something like /etc/backup-exclude.d/10-firefox-cache.exclude
   and user specific could be under ~/.config/fd.o/backup-exclude.d/
 - Make an "Advanced" page of backup plan configuration to tweak behaviors. Like whether to respect those exclude lists or not.
 - Clean up code for driveselection/driveselectiondelegate. Ugly to ask solid for devices from a paint() funtion!
