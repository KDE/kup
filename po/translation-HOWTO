For translators:

Please visit https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/kup/ and create an account 
there, join an existing language team or request a new language. Then just 
start translating directly in the web interface there or download the .po file 
for offline translation in a locally installed translation editor, for example 
virtaal, poedit or lokalize. Most texts should have a "context" attached to 
them, informing you a little about how each text string is used.

For developers:

The script called "extract-messages.sh" is designed to be run from the "po"
directory. It can be run at any time and should never cause any dataloss or
other problems. It extracts text strings that needs translation from the source
code and merges that with already existing translation files. Run it if the
source code has been changed with new or modified user-visible texts.

It also extracts texts from .desktop.template files that needs translation.
After that it spits out .desktop files by using those templates and
translations from all the *.po files in the po directory. So if you have
updated or added translations of the text strings from .desktop files, running
extract-messages.sh is needed to generate an updated .desktop file. That
generated .desktop file is kept in git for convenience.
